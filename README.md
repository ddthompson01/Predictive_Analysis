# Predictive Analysis Model to Predict Participation Trends

## Description

This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast participation trends in the CNP Program. The model currently uses two months of data (not included in this repo) to identify key factors influencing participation rates and to predict future trends. The insights derived from this model can help school administrators make data-driven decisions to improve participation rates and ensure better resource allocation.

Predictive Modeling:

  1. Implementation of a linear regression model to predict participation rates based on meal count data.
  2. Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared.
